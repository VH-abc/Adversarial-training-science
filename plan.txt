Plan:
- pick some settings
- measurement for A and (B | context)
- deployment distribution of contexts
- training distribution of contexts (may or may not have qualitative overlap)
- train and log the measurements

Political sycophancy setting:
- measurements:
    - behavioral sycophancy on various sets
    - accuracy on "is this person liberal or conservative" (on various sets)
- distributions:
    - political + the other two

Other setting ideas:
- "water freezing point" (or other substances):
    - A: water freezes at 0 celsius
    - context example: "I placed water in a glass outdoors in Yakutsk in december for 24 hours. Is it now liquid or solid?"
    - measurements:
        - liquid vs. solid judgement given the new rule
        - stated freezing point of water
        - answers to "what is the temperature of the water now"
-
